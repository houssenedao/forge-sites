# Laravel Forge sites list
Sometimes you just need to know what sites you have. In Forge site I dont like that near sites you cant see repo name or somthing, so sometimes you just need to know site by server.]

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/justutiz/forge-sites.git forge-sites`
`composer install`

# Configuration
You can change table columns in `app.php`.

# Usage
`php artisan sites`
